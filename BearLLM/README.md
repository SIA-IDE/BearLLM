## ðŸ“š Introduction
[BearLLM](https://github.com/RotCHM/RotCHM/tree/main/BearLLM) is a prior knowledge-enhanced bearing health management framework with a unified vibration signal representation. This framework transforms the signal to be tested into the frequency domain, enabling effective identification of spectral differences compared to the vibration signal under fault-free conditions. By aligning the vibration signal with the fault semantic embedding, we achieve a unified natural language response for various health management tasks through a fine-tuned language model with low computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that this framework achieves leading performance under thousands of working conditions.

We have uploaded a part of code and are constantly improving it.

## ðŸ’» Requirements
