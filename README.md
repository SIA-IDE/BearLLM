## 📚 Introduction
The [MBHM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SIA-IDE/MBHM) dataset is the first multimodal dataset designed for the study of bearing health management. It is divided into two parts: vibration signals and health management corpus. The vibration signals and condition information are derived from 9 publicly available datasets, and are still under continuous updating and improvement. The thousands of working conditions pose more difficult challenges for the identification model and better represent real-world usage scenarios.

[BearLLM](https://github.com/SIA-IDE/BearLLM) is a prior knowledge-enhanced bearing health management framework with a unified vibration signal representation. This framework transforms the signal to be tested into the frequency domain, enabling effective identification of spectral differences compared to the vibration signal under fault-free conditions. By aligning the vibration signal with the fault semantic embedding, we achieve a unified natural language response for various health management tasks through a fine-tuned language model with low computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that this framework achieves leading performance under thousands of working conditions.

## 💻 Requirements

The code is implemented in Python 3.12. The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
conda create --name bearllm python=3.12
conda activate bearllm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download Demo Data / Use Your Own Data

First, you need to download the `demo_data.json` from the [MBHM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SIA-IDE/MBHM/tree/main) dataset.
For users in mainland China, you can use the [mirror link](https://hf-mirror.com/datasets/SIA-IDE/MBHM/tree/main) to speed up the download:

Or, you can also build your own test data in the same format:
`instruction`: Text instruction for health management task.
`vib_data`: Vibration signal data to be identified, with a required duration of 1 second.
`ref_data`: Reference vibration signal data without faults, with a required duration of 1 second.

```json
{
    "instruction": "xxx.",
    "vib_data": [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, ...],
    "ref_data": [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, ...],
}
```

### 2. Download Weights

You can download the pre-trained weights of [Qwen2.5-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct/tree/main) from Hugging Face.

Additionally, you need to download the weights of [BearLLM](https://huggingface.co/SIA-IDE/BearLLM/tree/main).

### 3. Organize Files

It is recommended to organize the weights and test data as follows:

```
BearLLM/
├── qwen_weights/
│   ├── model.safetensors
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── config.json
│   └── other files...
├── bearllm_weights/
│   ├── vibration_adapter.pth
│   ├── adapter_config.json
│   └── adapter_model.safetensors
└── mbhm_dataset/
    └── demo_data.json 
```

### 4. Run Code
First, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify the data paths inside.
Then, you can run the code using the following command:

```bash
python run_demo.py
```

## ⚙️ Development

### 1. Download Dataset

First, you need to download the following files from the [MBHM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SIA-IDE/MBHM/tree/main) dataset. For users in mainland China, you can use the [mirror link](https://hf-mirror.com/datasets/SIA-IDE/MBHM/tree/main) to speed up the download:

- `data.hdf5`: Contains the vibration signal data.
- `corpus.json`: Contains the health management corpus.
- `metadata.sqlite`: Contains metadata information of the dataset.

### 2. Download Weights

You can download the pre-trained weights of [Qwen2.5-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct/tree/main) from Hugging Face.

### 3. Modify Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify the data paths inside.

### 4. Pre-train and Fine-tune Model

Pre-train according to `src/pre_training.py`.
Fine-tune according to `src/fine_tuning.py`.
